# A Sort of Soup
### or, The Colour Out of Earth

> You have a little compartment for the Press, and another little compartment for Mary Hutchinison, and another for Vita, and another for Dog Grizzle, and another for the Downs, and another for London fogs, and another for the Prince of Wales, and another for the lighthouse, no, I'm wrong, the lighthouse is allowed to play its beam over the whole lot, and their only Common Denominator is your own excitability over whichever compartment you choose to look into at the moment. But with me they all run together into a sort of soup.

> â€” Vita Sackville-West to Virginia Woolf, 4 February, 1926

This is a python script that downloads a digital elevation model of a random location on earth, from which it produces a randomly-colored shaded terrain map. It gets its data from [SRTM](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/) and [ASTER](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/astgtmv003/) 1 arc second DEMs and [Water](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmswbdv003/) [Body](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/astwbdv001/) Databases. To access these data, the script needs an [Earthdata EOSDIS login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new), that it will store [encrypted](https://github.com/zoggop/a-sort-of-soup/blob/main/catacomb.py).

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 (Other versions of Python 3 may work, but I haven't tested them.)

#### Python Modules:

- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)

- [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

Create a colorful image of terrain of a random location.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --new-login           Enter an Earthdata username & password and store it encrypted for
                        future use. Overwrites currently stored login information if any.
  --one-time-login      Enter an Earthdata username & password to use only for this run,
                        and do not store it.
  --previous, -p        Use previously downloaded data. --dimensions, --coordinates, and
                        --rotation will have no effect.
  --previous-colors     Use previously used colors. Any additional color arguments will
                        override those specific parts of the previously used colors.
  --no-water, -w        Do not draw bodies of water.
  --no-shade, -s        Do not hillshade the terrain. This leaves only gradient-mapped
                        elevations and water bodies.
  --output [FILEPATH], -o [FILEPATH]
                        Path to save output image. If not specified, will save to
                        ~/a_sort_of_soup/output.png along with elevation_gradient.tif,
                        hillshade.tif, and water.tif
  --coordinates LATITUDE LONGITUDE, -c LATITUDE LONGITUDE
                        Location of center of desired image in latitude longitude
                        coordinates. If not specified, a random location will be chosen.
  --dimensions WIDTH HEIGHT, -d WIDTH HEIGHT
                        Width and height in pixels of output image. Larger images will
                        require downloading more source tiles. Defaults to screen
                        dimensions.
  --rotation [0-3], -r [0-3]
                        How many times 90 degrees to rotate. (0: North is up. 1: East is
                        up. 2: South is up. 3: West is up.) If not specified, this will be
                        chosen randomly.
  --water-orient [0-3]  The orientation of the gradient with which bodies of water are
                        filled.
  --min-lightness [0-100]
                        Unless specified by --lightnesses, lightnesses will be randomly
                        chosen between --min-lightness and --max-lightness.
  --max-lightness [0-100]
                        Unless specified by --lightnesses, lightnesses will be randomly
                        chosen between --min-lightness and --max-lightness.
  --min-chroma [0-134]  Attempt to choose colors with at least this minimum chromaticity.
  --max-chroma [0-134]  Maximum chromaticity of image.
  --hue-delta [Delta-E]
                        Minimum color difference between hues as calculated by CIE Delta-E
                        2000 at 57 lightness and 32 chromaticity. Values over 35 will
                        usually cause Delta-E between hues to be uneven. If not specified,
                        this will be chosen randomly between 20 and 40.
  --lightnesses 0-100 [0-100 ...]
                        Up to three lightnesses, in order of elevation. The remaining
                        lightnesses will be chosen randomly.
  --chromas 0-134 [0-134 ...]
                        Up to three chromaticities, in order of elevation. The remaining
                        chromas will be chosen randomly. To specify only the second and/or
                        third chromaticities, enter chromaticities of -1 to have them
                        chosen randomly.
  --hues 0-359 [0-359 ...]
                        Up to three hues, in order of elevation. The remaining hues will
                        be chosen randomly. To specify only the second and/or third hue,
                        enter hues of -1 to have them chosen randomly.
  --water-colors L C H [L C H ...]
                        Any number of colors for the gradient to fill water bodies with,
                        formatted in a flat list of Lightness Chroma Hue triplets.
  --shadow-depth [0-1]  Intensity of hillshade dark tones.
  --shine [0-1]         Intensity of hillshade highlights.
